# Arch Ricing w/ i3wm
One of my hobbies is customizing my DE. If you have any questions, contact me via X.

services:          Where they should be stored:
1. i3              - ~/.config/i3/config
2. qterminal       - ~/.bashrc


i3 dependencies for my build:
firefox
cherrytree
virtualbox
xfce4
flameshot
thunar
pavucontrol
kmag
feh
brightnessctl
redshift
qterminal
virtualbox
i3lock-color(find this in github)
There's more, but i'll put them later
